# Vanilla Js projects

Front end mini projects

Most of the ideas for each projects are based on the course by Brad Traversy.

I tried to add my own little twist to each project, and some other ideas I found along the way.

This a list of projects by categories
(Number of the project in parentheses)

- Project 1: Form validator
- Project 2: Movie Tickets MiniApp
- Project 3: Custom Video Player

I started this project March 28, 2022.

Obviously, feel free to use any of the components for your own projects, these are not original ideas, I am just using them to learn and for portfolio purposes.
