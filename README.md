# 20 Vanila Js projects

Front end mini projects

The ideas for each projects are based on a course by Brad Traversy.

I tried to add my own little twist to each project.

This a list of projects:

- Project 1: Form validator
- Project 2: Movie Tickets MiniApp
- Project 3: Custom Video Player
- Project 4: Currency conversion
- Project 5: Canvas Breakout game
- Project 6: Hangman Game
- Project 7: Infinite scrolling with filter

I started this project March 28, 2022. Then took a hiatus due to extra courses I was taking. Started working again on July 23, 2022.

These are not original ideas, this is just done as practice and for portfolio purposes.
